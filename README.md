# What is it?
Font face to turn all characters into discs. Similar to the css property `-webkit-text-security: disc;` but it works on more than just webkit browsers.

This is useful when Chrome wants to prompt your users to save their passwords Every. Single. Time. but you don't want them doing that (eg. they're on a shared device).

# How do I use it?
In here, you'll find three font files (eot for ie, and tff/woff for everything else). You need them. There's also a start at a css file. That just defines the new font and stuff and then uses it on the p tag. Change this to suit whatever needs you have. Tada.
